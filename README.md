This is a portfolio application in progress done with React. Not pretty code and doesnt look the best but every project starts from somewhere :)

The idea is rather simple: a to do list application. Like all  of us.

what functions:
- adding a task
- deleting a task
- moving it in priority
- the starting point of aesthetics (yay!)
- server done with axios
- "finished tasks"
  
What is on the list?
- sign up and sign in pages
- adding pictures? Necessary? nope, but I want it :D
- grouping the tasks to some bigger things like a project or something --> requires: a user, the backend, other things?
- hosting this somewhere?
